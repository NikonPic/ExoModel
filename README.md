# FingerSim
>This repository represents the source code for a julia based Differential Equation of the Coupled Index Finger and Exoskeleton

Project to build up a biomechanic finger-simulator:
Main goals are:
1. Defining the differential equation
2. Apply the exoscelett structure
3. Apply Different Material properties and viscoleastic effects
4. Fit the model to test-data
5. Improve the model by applying the optimal exoskeletton
